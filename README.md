# University-Admission-Form
This GitHub repository contains my Fifth Semester Project which is a ready-to-use HTML/CSS template for creating a university admission form. The form is designed using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, providing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for collecting admission information from prospective students.
